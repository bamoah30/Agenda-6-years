# 🦄 Agenda-6-Years

This is my master roadmap — a 6-year transformation from Mechanical Engineer to Futuristic Unicorn Engineer, blending intelligent software with mechanical depth.

## 📍 Current Status

- **Phase:** Year 1, Month 1
- **Focus:** Python fundamentals + first AI portfolio project
- **Active Repo:** [`ai-data-analyzer`](https://github.com/bamoah30/ai-data-analyzer)

## 🎯 Vision

> Build intelligent systems that think, move, and adapt — one commit at a time.
