Turn a VS Code folder into a GitHub repo
Steps:
1.Initialize Git in the folder
   - Open the terminal in VS Code.
   - Run:
     git init

     This creates a hidden `.git` folder and turns your project into a Git repository.

2. Add your files to Git
   git add .

3. Commit your changes
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   

4. Create a new repo on GitHub
   - Go to GitHub → click New Repository.
   - Give it a name (e.g., `sql-query-dashboard`).
   - Leave it empty (don’t add README or .gitignore if you already have them locally).

5. Connect your local repo to GitHub
   - Copy the repo’s URL (HTTPS or SSH).
   - In VS Code terminal:
     git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/sql-query-dashboard.git
     

6. Push your code to GitHub
   
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   


If you’ve already created a repo on GitHub and want to work on it locally:
Steps:
1. Copy the repo link
   - On GitHub, click the green Code button → copy the HTTPS or SSH link.

2. Open terminal in VS Code (or any terminal)
   - Navigate to the folder where you want the repo to live.

3. Clone the repo
   
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/sql-query-dashboard.git
   

4. Open the cloned folder in VS Code
   - Either `cd sql-query-dashboard` in terminal, or open it directly in VS Code.

5. Start working locally
   - Make changes → `git add .` → `git commit -m "message"` → `git push`.
