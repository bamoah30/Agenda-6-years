**Reading the Values of Resistors**

Resistors can be valued using either **color codes** or **alphanumeric codes**.

### Color Code Method

When reading color-coded resistors, it is advisable to rotate the resistor so that the tolerance band is on the right. That means, all the colors should be closer to the left than they are to the right of the resistor.

- The **first color** represents the first digit.
- The **second color** represents the second digit.
- The **third color** represents the multiplier.
- The **last color** represents the tolerance.

#### Resistor Color Code Table

| Color  | Digit Value | Multiplier (Ω)  | Tolerance (%) |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Black  | 0           | × 1             | —             |
| Brown  | 1           | × 10            | ±1%           |
| Red    | 2           | × 100           | ±2%           |
| Orange | 3           | × 1,000         | —             |
| Yellow | 4           | × 10,000        | —             |
| Green  | 5           | × 100,000       | ±0.5%         |
| Blue   | 6           | × 1,000,000     | ±0.25%        |
| Violet | 7           | × 10,000,000    | ±0.1%         |
| Gray   | 8           | × 100,000,000   | ±0.05%        |
| White  | 9           | × 1,000,000,000 | —             |
| Gold   | —           | × 0.1           | ±5%           |
| Silver | —           | × 0.01          | ±10%          |
| None   | —           | —               | ±20%          |

#### Examples

- A resistor with bands **red, violet, yellow, gold** corresponds to 27 × 10⁴ Ω = 270 kΩ with ±5% tolerance.
- A resistor with bands **brown, black, red, silver** corresponds to 1 × 10² Ω = 100 Ω with ±10% tolerance.

### Alphanumeric Code Method

Some resistors use letters and numbers in their ratings.

Examples:

1. **6R2 resistor** = 6.2 Ω resistor
2. **92K3 resistor** = 92.3 × 10³ Ω resistor (92.3 kΩ)
3. **4M8 resistor** = 4.8 × 10⁶ Ω resistor (4.8 MΩ)

P = IV = V^2/R = I^2R


Where:  
- P = Power (Watts, W)  
- I = Current (Amperes, A)  
- V = Voltage (Volts, V)  
- R = Resistance (Ohms, Ω)  

Power = Work / Time = Energy / Time  
Energy is measured in Joules (J).  
1 Watt = 1 Joule per second.  


Energy (J) = Charge (C) * Voltage (V)

Therefore:  

Power (W) = (Charge (C) * Voltage (V)) /Time (s)


Since Charge/Time = Current (A), we can rewrite the equation as:  

Power (W) = Current (A) * Voltage (V)
This confirms the original formula P = IV.
