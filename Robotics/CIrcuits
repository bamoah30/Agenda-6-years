Reading the vlaues of resistors:
Some resistor are valued with colors.
When reading such color code resistors, It's is advisable to rotate the resistor such that the colors are on the left.
The first color is the first digit, the second color the second digit , the third color is the multipler and the last color is the tolerance.

However some resistors alos have letters and numbers in the ratings.
For example:

1. 6R2 resistor = 6.2 ohms resistor
2. 92K3 resistor = 92.3 \* 10^(3) ohms resistor
3. 4M8 resistor = 4.8 \* 10^6 ohmns resistor.
