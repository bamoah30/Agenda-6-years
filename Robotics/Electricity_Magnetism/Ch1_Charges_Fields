Electric Charge:

- Charge is conserved and quantized.

Conservation of Charge:

- The total charge in an isolated system never changes.
- By isolated, we mean that no matter is allowed to cross the boundary of the system.

Note: Photons (particles of light) carry no charge.

Charge Conservation Law:

- The total electric charge in an isolated system, i.e., the algebraic sum of positive and negative charges present at any time, never changes.

Coulomb's Law:

- Two stationary electric charges repel or attract one another with a force proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Mathematically:

    F₂ = k * (q₁ * q₂ / r²) * r̂

Where:

- q₁ and q₂ are scalars giving the magnitude and sign of the respective charges.
- r̂ is the unit vector in the direction from charge 1 to charge 2.
- F₂ is the force acting on charge 2.
- k = 8.988 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²

Note: The magnitude of e, the fundamental quantum of electric charge, is approximately:

    e ≈ 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C

Gaussian Unit of Charge:

- The electrostatic unit (esu) is defined so that the constant k in Coulomb's law equals 1 when r is measured in cm, F in dynes, and q in esu.

Conversions:
1 N = 10⁵ dynes
1 C = 3 × 10⁹ esu

Thus, the magnitude of the electron charge is approximately:

    e ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C ≈ 4.8 × 10⁻¹⁰ esu
