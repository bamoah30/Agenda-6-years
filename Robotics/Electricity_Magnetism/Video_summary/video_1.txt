CHARGE

Charge is a property of matter that enables it to exhibit electric and magnetic behavior.

Charge can also be defined as the excess or deficiency of electrons in a body.

Charge is a scalar quantity.

Unit of Charge:

* SI unit: Coulomb (C) or Ampere-second (A·s)
* Electrostatic unit (esu), also called statcoulomb or franklin
* Electromagnetic unit (emu)
* The largest practical unit is the Faraday

Relations between units:
1 Faraday = 96,500 C
1 emu = 10 C

Order of magnitude:
1 Faraday > 1 emu > 1 C > 1 esu

Dimension of charge:
[Q] = AT
Where:
A = ampere
T = time

PROPERTIES OF CHARGE

1. Conservation of Charge
   Charge can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred from one body to another.

Examples of charge carriers:

Positive Charge Carriers        Negative Charge Carriers
Glass rod                      Silk cloth
Wool                           Ebonite
Dry hair                       Comb
Cat’s hair                     Plastic

2. Quantization of Charge

i. Charge is a quantized quantity.
ii. Charge always exists as an integral multiple of the elementary charge.

Elementary charge:
e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C

Formula:
q = ne

Where:
q = charge on a body
n = number of electrons
e = charge of one electron

Note on Quarks:
Quarks are responsible for the formation of protons and neutrons.
Protons and neutrons are made of up and down quarks.

Up quark = +2/3 e
Down quark = −1/3 e

3. Change in Mass During Charging

Whenever a body is charged, its mass changes.

Change in mass:
Δm = n × mₑ

Where:
Δm = change in mass
n = number of electrons transferred
mₑ = mass of one electron = 9.1 × 10⁻³¹ kg

Since:
q = ne
⇒ n = q / e

Therefore:
Δm = (q / e) × mₑ

NOTE ON TYPES OF CHARGE MOTION

* Static charge → Electric field only
* Moving charge → Electric field + Magnetic field
* Accelerated charge → Electric field + Magnetic field + Electromagnetic waves

Electrostatics is the study of electric charges at rest and the electric fields they produce.

4. Interaction of Charges

* Like charges repel each other.
* Unlike charges attract each other.
* A charged body attracts an uncharged body.

RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY

Relative permittivity (εᵣ) is defined as:

εᵣ = Permittivity of a medium / Permittivity of vacuum

εᵣ = ε / ε₀
⇒ ε = εᵣ ε₀

Values of relative permittivity:
Vacuum = 1
Air = 1.003
Glass = 2.3
Water = 80.82

ELECTRIC FIELD

An electric field is an imaginary region around a charge where another charge experiences an attractive or repulsive force.

---

INTENSITY OF ELECTRIC FIELD

Electric field intensity is defined as the force per unit positive test charge placed in the field.

E = F / q₀
⇒ F = Eq₀

Properties of electric field intensity:

1. It is a vector quantity.
2. Its dimension is: M L T⁻³ A⁻¹
3. Direction:

   * Outward from a positive charge
   * Inward toward a negative charge

---

ELECTRIC FIELD LINES

Electric field lines are imaginary lines used to represent electric fields.

* For a positive charge: field lines start from the charge and extend to infinity.
* For a negative charge: field lines start from infinity and end at the charge.

Note:
The intensity of an electric field depends on the density of field lines.

Electric field intensity ∝ density of field lines

ELECTRIC FLUX

Electric flux is defined as the number of electric field lines passing perpendicularly through a unit area.

ϕ = E · A
ϕ = EA cos θ

Where:
ϕ = electric flux
E = electric field intensity
A = area
θ = angle between E and A

Properties of electric flux:

* It is a scalar quantity.
* Unit:
  N/C · m² = V/m · m² = V·m

Direction:

* Outward for positive charges
* Inward for negative charges
