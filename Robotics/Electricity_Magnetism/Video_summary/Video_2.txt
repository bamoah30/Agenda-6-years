CURRENT ELECTRICITY

Electric current is defined as the amount of electric charge flowing through a given cross-sectional area per unit time.

It can also be defined as the rate of flow of electric charge.

Mathematical expressions:

Average current:
I = Q / t
or
I = ΔQ / Δt

Instantaneous current:
I = dQ / dt

Since:
Q = ne

Therefore:
I = ne / t

Where:
I = electric current (ampere, A)
Q = charge (coulomb, C)
t = time (seconds, s)
n = number of electrons
e = charge of one electron = 1.603 × 10⁻¹⁹ C

INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING CURRENT

Ammeter:

* Used to measure electric current in a circuit.

Galvanometer:

* Used to detect very small electric currents.

Note:
A galvanometer is more sensitive than an ammeter.

ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

Definition:
Electric potential at a point is the amount of work done in bringing a unit positive test charge from infinity to that point in an electric field.

Mathematical expression:
V = W / Q

Unit:
J/C = volt (V)

Notes:
1 J = 1 C·V
1 eV = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ J

Measurement:
Electric potential is measured using a voltmeter.

Important points about a voltmeter:

* It is connected in parallel with the component.
* It has very high internal resistance.

Electric potential due to a point charge:
V = kq / r

ELECTRIC POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE

Definition:
Electric potential difference between two points is the work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to another.

Simply stated:
It is the difference in electric potential between two points.

Mathematical expression:
V_BA = V_B − V_A

Since:
V = W / q

Therefore:
W = qV = q(V_B − V_A)

Note:
Electric charges, electric current, and electric field lines move from a region of higher electric potential to a region of lower electric potential.

VARIABLE RESISTANCE

Variable resistor:
A device used to change the current in a circuit without changing the voltage source.

Rheostat:
A device specifically used to vary resistance in an electric circuit.

OHM’S LAW

Statement:
If the physical conditions of a conductor (such as temperature and material) are kept constant, the current flowing through it is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends.

Mathematical expression:
V = IR

Where:
V = potential difference (voltage)
I = electric current
R = resistance (constant of proportionality)
