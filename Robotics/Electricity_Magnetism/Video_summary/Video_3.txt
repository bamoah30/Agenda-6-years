KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS

---

First Law: Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)

Statement:
At any node (junction) in an electric circuit, the algebraic sum of currents is equal to zero.

Mathematically:
ΣI = 0

Definition of a Node:
A node is a point in a circuit where two or more conducting wires meet.

In other words:
The sum of currents entering a node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the node.

Note:
Kirchhoff’s Current Law is based on the law of conservation of charge.

Second Law: Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)

Statement:
In any closed loop of an electric circuit, the algebraic sum of all voltages is equal to zero.

Mathematically:
ΣV = 0

In other words:
In a closed circuit, the voltage supplied by the source (battery) is equal to the total voltage drop across all components in the loop.

Notes:

* Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law is based on the law of conservation of energy.
* The polarity (positive or negative sign) of a voltage depends on the direction of current relative to the component’s terminals.

SERIES AND PARALLEL CONNECTIONS

Series Connection of Resistors:

1. The same current flows through all components connected in series.
2. The source voltage is divided among the connected components.

Parallel Connection of Resistors:

1. The voltage across each component is the same.
2. The total current is divided among the connected components.

ELECTRIC POWER

Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is converted into other forms of energy.

Formulas:
P = VI
P = I²R
P = V² / R

Where:
P = electric power (watt, W)
V = voltage (volt, V)
I = current (ampere, A)
R = resistance (ohm, Ω)

Note:
For rating electrical appliances, the expression
P = V² / R
is most commonly used.

ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY OF WIRES

Order of electrical conductivity:
Ag > Cu > Al > W

SHORT CIRCUIT AND FUSE WIRE

Short Circuit:
A short circuit occurs when a very large current flows through a wire, exceeding the safe current limit of the wire.

Fuse Wire:
A fuse wire melts when excessive current flows through it, thereby breaking the circuit and protecting electrical devices.
