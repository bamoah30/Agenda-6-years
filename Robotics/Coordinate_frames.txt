Coordinate Frames

1. Body Frame
   - A coordinate system fixed to the robot or moving body itself.
   - The axes move and rotate with the robot.
   - Useful for describing motions, forces, and velocities relative to the robot’s own orientation.

2. Global Coordinate Frame
   - A fixed, world-based reference frame that does not move with the robot.
   - Often aligned with geographic directions (East, North, Up).
   - Provides a universal reference for absolute position and orientation.

3. Moving Coordinate Frame
   - A temporary or task-specific frame that moves relative to the global frame.
   - Often attached to a tool, end effector, or another moving part.
   - Useful for analyzing local interactions or transformations during motion.

4. Camera Frame
   - A coordinate system attached to the robot’s camera or vision sensor.
   - Defines directions relative to the camera’s perspective (Right, Down, Forward).
   - Essential for computer vision tasks, image processing, and mapping visual data into robot/world coordinates.


Axis Mapping:
                Body Axis        Global Axis        Camera Frame
x-axis:         Forward          East               Right
y-axis:         Left             North              Down
z-axis:         Up               Up                 Forward

Note: The End Effector refers to anything with which the robot interacts with its environment.


Coordinate Transformation

1. Pure Translation Transformation
   X = x + d

   where:
   X = coordinate of the point with respect to the fixed frame
   x = coordinate of the point with respect to the moving frame
   d = coordinate of the origin of the moving frame with respect to the fixed frame


2. Pure Rotation Transformation
   X = R · x

   where:
   X = coordinate of the point with respect to the fixed frame
   R = rotational transformation matrix:
       [ cosθ   -sinθ ]
       [ sinθ    cosθ ]
   x = coordinate of the point with respect to the moving frame


3. Combined Translation and Rotation Transformation
   X = T · x

   where:
   X = coordinate of the body with respect to the fixed frame
       [ X ]
       [ Y ]
       [ 1 ]

   T = homogeneous transformation matrix:
       [ cosθ   -sinθ    a ]
       [ sinθ    cosθ    b ]
       [  0       0      1 ]


Homogeneous Transformation:
- A homogeneous transformation is a mathematical representation that combines both rotation and translation into a single matrix.
- It uses an extra dimension (the "1" at the bottom of the vector) to allow translations to be expressed in matrix form, alongside rotations.
- This unified format makes it easier to chain multiple transformations together (e.g., moving, rotating, and shifting a robot or object in space).
- In robotics, homogeneous transformations are fundamental for describing how points, frames, and objects relate to each other in 2D or 3D space.

NB: All robotic systems obey the Right-Hand Rule.

Right-Hand Rule:
If you extend your thumb, index finger, and middle finger such that they are all
mutually perpendicular (90° to each other):

- Thumb → points upward → z-axis
- Index finger → points forward (away from you) → x-axis
- Middle finger → points sideways → y-axis

Mapping:
Refers to changing the description of a point in space from one frame to another.

Types of Robot Configurations:

1. Cartesian Coordinate Configuration:
   - Uses three linear axes (X, Y, Z).
   - Provides straight-line motion along each axis.
   - Common in CNC machines and 3D printers.

2. Cylindrical Configuration:
   - Combines linear motion along one axis with rotational motion around another.
   - Suitable for tasks requiring vertical movement and rotation.
   - Often used in assembly and handling operations.

3. Spherical Configuration:
   - Provides two rotational motions and one linear motion.
   - Allows the robot to reach points in a spherical workspace.
   - Useful for welding, painting, and inspection tasks.

4. Articulated Configuration:
   - Uses rotary joints (like a human arm).
   - Offers high flexibility and a large workspace.
   - Common in industrial robots for complex tasks such as assembly, packaging, and material handling.

5. SCARA Configuration (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm):
   - Provides compliance in the horizontal plane but rigidity in the vertical axis.
   - Ideal for high-speed assembly, pick-and-place, and precision tasks.
   - Frequently used in electronics manufacturing.
