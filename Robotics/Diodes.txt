Diodes:
Electronic devices that allow current to flow in only one direction.
For current to flow through a diode, the striped end is connected to the negative and the black end is connected to the positive — Forward bias.
Negative bias occurs when the reverse connection is made, causing the diode to act as an insulator.

Note: The anode is connected to the P-type diode and the cathode to the N-type diode.
You can create a P-type diode by doping silicon with aluminum.
N-type diodes are created by doping silicon with phosphorus.

Note: A quick way to determine if a diode is on is to know the direction of the current and compare it with the direction of the arrow.
If the arrow on the diode is in the same direction as the current, the diode is on; otherwise, it is off.

Types of Diodes:
- P-N Junction (standard rectifier): Used in household power supplies
- Zener (precise reverse voltage regulation): Used for voltage reference and surge protection
- Schottky (low forward voltage drop and ultra-fast switching): Perfect for high-speed rectifiers and RF mixers
- LED: Common indicators and display lighting
- Photodiode: Produces current when exposed to light; used in light sensors and optical communications
- Avalanche: Designed for controlled breakdown at high reverse bias; ideal for high-voltage protection

Right-Hand Rule:
Point your right thumb in the direction of the current and curl the remaining fingers.
The direction of the curled fingers shows the direction of the magnetic field.
