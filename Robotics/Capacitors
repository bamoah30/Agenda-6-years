# Capacitors

A **capacitor** is a device that stores electric charge in an electric field.  
It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material (vacuum, air, or dielectric).

---

## Capacitance

The ability of a capacitor to store charge is called **capacitance**.

- **Unit:** Farad (F)
- **Definition:**

\[
C = \frac{Q}{V}
\]

where:

- \(C\) = capacitance (F)
- \(Q\) = charge stored (Coulombs, C)
- \(V\) = potential difference (Volts, V)

---

## Charge

\[
Q = n \cdot e
\]

where:

- \(n\) = number of electrons
- \(e\) = charge of a single electron = \(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\,\text{C}\)

---

## Voltage

Voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points.

- **Unit:** Volt (V)
- **Definition:**

\[
1\,\text{V} = \frac{1\,\text{J}}{1\,\text{C}}
\]

where:

- J = Joule (unit of energy)
- C = Coulomb (unit of charge)

---

## Electric Field

\[
E = \frac{V}{d}
\]

where:

- \(E\) = electric field strength (V/m)
- \(V\) = potential difference (Volts)
- \(d\) = separation distance between plates (m)

---

## Surface Charge Density

\[
\sigma = \frac{Q}{A}
\]

where:

- \(\sigma\) = surface charge density (C/m\(^2\))
- \(Q\) = charge (C)
- \(A\) = plate area (m\(^2\))

---

## Relation Between Electric Field and Surface Charge Density

\[
E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}
\]

where:

- \(\varepsilon_0\) = permittivity of free space = \(8.85 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{F/m}\)

---

## Capacitance of a Parallel Plate Capacitor

Combining the above relations:

\[
C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d}
\]

where:

- \(C\) = capacitance (F)
- \(\varepsilon_0\) = permittivity of free space (F/m)
- \(A\) = plate area (m\(^2\))
- \(d\) = separation distance (m)

---

## Effect of a Dielectric

When a dielectric material is introduced between the plates, the capacitance increases:

\[
C = \frac{\varepsilon A}{d} = \frac{\varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0 A}{d}
\]

where:

- \(\varepsilon\) = permittivity of the dielectric (F/m)
- \(\varepsilon_r\) = relative permittivity (dimensionless dielectric constant)
- \(\varepsilon_0\) = permittivity of free space (F/m)
- \(A\) = plate area (m\(^2\))
- \(d\) = separation distance (m)

---

## Key Notes

- Larger plate area (\(A\)) → higher capacitance.
- Smaller plate separation (\(d\)) → higher capacitance.
- Introducing a dielectric (\(\varepsilon_r > 1\)) → increases capacitance.
