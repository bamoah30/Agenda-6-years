Transistors:
An electronic device used as a switch or for amplification. Transistors also drive large currents to power devices.

Types of Transistors:

1. Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT)
2. Field Effect Transistors (FET)

Types of Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT):

1. NPN Transistor:

   - Base = P-type
   - Emitter and Collector = N-type
   - In NPN, the emitter is usually connected to ground.
   - Current flow: The emitter current flows OUT of the base.

2. PNP Transistor:
   - Base = N-type
   - Emitter and Collector = P-type
   - In PNP, the base and collector are usually connected to ground.
   - Current flow: The emitter current flows INTO the base.

Important Relations:
Ic = β Ib
β = hFE
IE = Ic + Ib

where:
Ic : Collector current (the current flowing through the collector terminal)
Ib : Base current (the current flowing into the base terminal)
IE : Emitter current (the current flowing through the emitter terminal)
β (beta) : Current gain of the transistor (ratio of collector current to base current)
hFE : Another notation for β (DC current gain)

Operating Regions of a Transistor:

1. Cutoff Region:

   - Both junctions are reverse biased.
   - Ic ≈ 0 (collector current is nearly zero).
   - Transistor acts like an OPEN switch.

2. Active Region:

   - Base-emitter junction is forward biased, base-collector junction is reverse biased.
   - Transistor operates as an AMPLIFIER.
   - Ic ≈ β Ib.

3. Saturation Region:
   - Both junctions are forward biased.
   - Maximum current flows through the transistor.
   - Transistor acts like a CLOSED switch.

Summary:
NPN: Current flows out of the base.
PNP: Current flows into the base.
Transistors can act as switches (cutoff/saturation) or amplifiers (active region).
