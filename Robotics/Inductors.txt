Inductors

Inductors are electrical components that store energy in a magnetic field. 
They are typically made of coils of wire and resist changes in current flow.

The energy (U) stored in an inductor is given by the formula:

U = 1/2 L I^2

Where:
U = Energy stored in the inductor (Joules)
L = Inductance (Henrys)
I = Current through the inductor (Amperes)

Faraday's Law:
A change in current causes a change in magnetic flux, leading to an induced emf,
which opposes the flow of current.

Inductance:
The ability of conductors to oppose change in current by inducing an emf is called inductance.

Formulas:
E = -N (dΦ/dt) = -L (dI/dt)

Where:
E = induced emf
N = number of coils
Φ = magnetic flux
L = inductance (henry, H = V·s/A)
I = current

Note:
Switching off a circuit with an inductor might cause sparks.

Magnetic Flux:
Φ = B · A

Magnetic Field:
B = Φ / A
