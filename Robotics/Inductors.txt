Inductors

Inductors are electrical components that store energy in a magnetic field. 
They are typically made of coils of wire and resist changes in current flow.

The energy (U) stored in an inductor is given by the formula:

U = 1/2 L I^2

Where:
U = Energy stored in the inductor (Joules)
L = Inductance (Henrys)
I = Current through the inductor (Amperes)
