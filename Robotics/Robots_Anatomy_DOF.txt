===============================
Robot Anatomy
===============================
Robot anatomy is the study of the skeleton of robots, i.e. 
the physical construction of the manipulator structure.

Main Components:
1. End Effector – The device at the end of a robot arm designed to interact with the environment (e.g., grippers, tools).
2. Manipulator – The mechanical arm structure that positions and moves the end effector.
3. Actuator – A motor or mechanism that drives movement in joints or links.
4. Controller – The system that sends commands to actuators and coordinates robot actions.
5. Sensors – Devices that provide feedback about the robot’s environment or internal state (e.g., vision, force).
6. Processor – The computing unit that processes sensor data and executes control algorithms.
7. Software – The programs and instructions that define robot behavior and tasks.

===============================
Types of Joints
===============================
1. Rotary Joints – Allow rotational motion (like a hinge).
2. Linear Joints – Allow translational or sliding motion.

===============================
Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
===============================
Robots typically have 6 DOF, representing independent movements:
1. Rotational Transverse – Rotation around a horizontal axis.
2. Vertical Transverse – Up-and-down movement along a vertical axis.
3. Radial Transverse – Movement outward or inward from a central axis.
4. Roll – Rotation around the arm’s longitudinal axis.
5. Yaw – Rotation left or right around a vertical axis.
6. Pitch – Rotation up or down around a horizontal axis.

===============================
End Effectors - Grippers
===============================
1. Mechanical Grippers – Use fingers or jaws to grasp objects.
2. Hook and Scoops – Simple tools for lifting or carrying.
3. Magnetic Grippers:
   a. Electromagnet – Uses electric current to generate magnetic force.
   b. Permanent Magnet – Uses fixed magnetic material to hold objects.
4. Vacuum Gripper – Uses suction to lift objects with flat surfaces.
5. Expandable Type Gripper – Adjusts size to grip objects of varying dimensions.
6. Adhesive Gripper – Uses sticky or tacky materials (like specialized adhesives or gecko-inspired surfaces) 
   to hold objects by surface adhesion rather than mechanical force.

NB: The application of the robot determines the choice of end effector.


Robotics Notes — December 2, 2025

Degree of Freedom (DOF):
- Definition: Number of independent movements an object can perform in 2D or 3D space.
- Notes:
  NB1: Any rigid body in 3D has 6 DOF
  NB2: Any rigid body in 2D has 3 DOF
  NB3: In an open kinematic chain, DOF = number of joints

Gruebler’s Criterion:
- Used to calculate DOF in structures.

For 2D:
M = 3n - Σ(3 - Cl), from m = 1 to n

For 3D:
M = 6n - Σ(6 - Cl), from m = 1 to n

Where:
M  = Mobility (DOF)
n  = Number of links
m  = Number of joints
Cl = Constraint per joint

Joint Notes:
- Spherical joint = Universal joint (2 DOF) + Revolute joint (1 DOF)
- Prismatic joint = 1 DOF

------------------------------------------------------------

Robot Configurations:

1. Cartesian Configuration:
- Structure: 3 prismatic joints
- Workspace: Portion of space around manipulator base accessible by endpoint
- Work volume: Space swept by the arm
- Work envelope: Surface boundary of workspace
- Pros: High precision, easy programming, large work volume
- Cons: Low dexterity

2. Cylindrical Configuration (RPP):
- Workspace: Hollow cylinder
- Application: Useful for machine loading operations due to access in narrow horizontal configurations

3. Polar / Spherical Configuration:
- Workspace: Partial spherical shell
- Features:
  • Shoulder joint allows end effector to move below base
  • Lower stiffness than Cartesian and Cylindrical
  • Positioning accuracy decreases with radial stroke
- Applications: Machining, spray painting

4. Articulated Configuration:
- Structure: Human-arm-like (anthropomorphic manipulation)
- Workspace: Spherical volume
- Features:
  • Endpoint can reach base and below
  • Highest dexterity (all joints movable)

------------------------------------------------------------

Other Configurations:
- SCARA (3R + 1P): Combination of articulated + cylindrical
- Wrist Configurations: Specialized for orientation control
- RPY Configuration:
  R = Roll (rotation in plane perpendicular to arm end)
  P = Pitch (rotation in vertical plane through the arm)
  Y = Yaw (rotation in horizontal plane)

Robotics Notes

NB1: Robot
- A machine programmable by a computer
- Capable of carrying out complex series of actions automatically

NB2: Robotics
- A field of technology that deals with the conceptual design, construction, operation, and application of robots

NB3: Robot Manipulator
- Consists of two sections:
  1. Body and Arm: For positioning of objects in the robot’s work volume
  2. Wrist Assembly: For orientation of objects

----------------------------------------------------
Joint Notation Scheme
----------------------------------------------------
1. Joint symbols used to designate joint types:
   - L = Linear
   - O = Orthogonal
   - R = Rotational
   - T = Twisting
   - V = Revolving

2. Separate body-and-arm assembly from wrist assembly using a colon.
   Example: TLR : TR

   → This represents a 5 DOF manipulator:
     - Body & Arm: Twisting, Linear, Rotational
     - Wrist: Twisting, Rotational

----------------------------------------------------
Drive Systems in Robots
----------------------------------------------------
1. Electric: Uses motors to actuate individual joints
2. Hydraulic: Uses hydraulic pistons and rotary vane actuators
3. Pneumatic: Used in smaller robots and simple material transfer applications

----------------------------------------------------
Sensors in Robots
----------------------------------------------------
NB: Two categories of sensors in robots:
1. Internal Sensors
   - Control position and velocity of manipulator joints

2. External Sensors
   - Coordinate robot operation with other equipment in the work cell
   - Types include:
     - Tactile: Touch and force sensors
     - Proximity: Determine how close an object is
     - Optical: Detect light intensity, color, or position; often implemented as optical encoders
     - Machine Vision: Use cameras and image-processing algorithms to identify, inspect, and guide objects
     - Other sensors: temperature, voltage, etc.
