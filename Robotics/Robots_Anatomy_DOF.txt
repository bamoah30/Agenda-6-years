Robot Anatomy
===============================
Robot anatomy is the study of the skeleton of robots, i.e. 
the physical construction of the manipulator structure.

Main Components:
1. End Effector – The device at the end of a robot arm designed to interact with the environment (e.g., grippers, tools).
2. Manipulator – The mechanical arm structure that positions and moves the end effector.
3. Actuator – A motor or mechanism that drives movement in joints or links.
4. Controller – The system that sends commands to actuators and coordinates robot actions.
5. Sensors – Devices that provide feedback about the robot’s environment or internal state (e.g., vision, force).
6. Processor – The computing unit that processes sensor data and executes control algorithms.
7. Software – The programs and instructions that define robot behavior and tasks.

===============================
Types of Joints
===============================
1. Rotary Joints – Allow rotational motion (like a hinge).
2. Linear Joints – Allow translational or sliding motion.

===============================
Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
===============================
Robots typically have 6 DOF, representing independent movements:
1. Rotational Transverse – Rotation around a horizontal axis.
2. Vertical Transverse – Up-and-down movement along a vertical axis.
3. Radial Transverse – Movement outward or inward from a central axis.
4. Roll – Rotation around the arm’s longitudinal axis.
5. Yaw – Rotation left or right around a vertical axis.
6. Pitch – Rotation up or down around a horizontal axis.

===============================
End Effectors - Grippers
===============================
1. Mechanical Grippers – Use fingers or jaws to grasp objects.
2. Hook and Scoops – Simple tools for lifting or carrying.
3. Magnetic Grippers:
   a. Electromagnet – Uses electric current to generate magnetic force.
   b. Permanent Magnet – Uses fixed magnetic material to hold objects.
4. Vacuum Gripper – Uses suction to lift objects with flat surfaces.
5. Expandable Type Gripper – Adjusts size to grip objects of varying dimensions.
6. Adhesive Gripper – Uses sticky or tacky materials (like specialized adhesives or gecko-inspired surfaces) 
   to hold objects by surface adhesion rather than mechanical force.

NB: The application of the robot determines the choice of end effector.
