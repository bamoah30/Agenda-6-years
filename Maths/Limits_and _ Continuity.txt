Limits describe how a function behaves near a point, instead of at the point.

Symbolic representation of the limit of a function:
lim f(x) = L (Read as : The limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L)
x → a

Notes:
1.When the numbers you use to determine the limit of a function increase towards the said number (x → a⁻), we call it Approaching from the Left.
2.When the numbers you use to determine the limit of a function decrease towards the said number (x → a⁺), we call it Approaching from the Right.
3.A function might be undefined at a point, but its limit can exist at that point.
4.The limit only exists if the right-hand limit and the left-hand limit both approach the same value.

Unbounded Limit:
This occurs when approaching the limit from both sides does not produce a finite value.
In such a situation, we say the limit does not exist.

Using Tables to Approximate Limit Values

Limits are tools for reasoning about function behavior, and tables are tools for reasoning about limits.

NB 1: When using a table to approximate limits, it is important to construct it in a way that simulates the feeling of getting "infinitely close" to a desired x-value.

NB 2: Sometimes the limit of a function is different from the actual value of the function at that point.

Properties of Limits:

Assume:
1. lim (f(x)) = L, as x → c
2. lim (g(x)) = M, as x → c

Rules:

1. Sum Rule:
   lim (f(x) + g(x)) = L + M, as x → c

2. Difference Rule:
   lim (f(x) - g(x)) = L - M, as x → c

3. Product Rule:
   lim (f(x) · g(x)) = L · M, as x → c

4. Constant Multiple Rule:
   lim (k · f(x)) = k · L, as x → c

5. Quotient Rule:
   lim (f(x) / g(x)) = L / M, as x → c
   (provided M ≠ 0)

6. Power Rule:
   lim (f(x))^(r/s) = (L)^(r/s), as x → c
   (where r and s are integers, s ≠ 0)


Limits of Composite Functions:

lim (f(g(x))) = f(lim (g(x))), as x → a
Only if:
1. lim (g(x)) = L exists, as x → a
2. f(L) is continuous

Note:
The limit of the internal function g(x) may not exist,
but the limit of the composite function f(g(x)) can still exist.

NB: f(x) is continuous at x = a if:
     lim f(x) = f(a), as x → a

NB: When you evaluate f(a)/g(a) for lim f(x)/g(x), as x → a, 
    and you get 0/0, we refer to that as an indeterminate form.

How to solve indeterminate limits:
1. Factor if possible
2. Multiply by the conjugate if it involves radicals
3. Replace some terms with trigonometric identities if possible and solve

Squeeze Theorem:
For f(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ h(x),
if lim f(x) = L and lim h(x) = L as x → c,
then lim g(x) = L, as x → c

NB: lim (sin x)/x = 1, as x → 0

Types of discontinuity:
1. Point/Removable Discontinuity:
   Both right-hand and left-hand limits as x approaches c are equal,
   but not equal to f(c).

2. Asymptotic Discontinuity:
   Both right-hand and left-hand limits are unbounded.

3. Jump Discontinuity:
   Both right-hand and left-hand limits exist but are not equal.

========================
CONTINUITY
========================
NB: A function is continuous at a point if you can intuitively draw the graph of the function 
through the point without lifting your marker.

Continuity over an interval:
1. f(x) is continuous over the interval (a, b) if it is continuous at every point in the interval.
2. f(x) is continuous over the interval [a, b] if it is continuous over (a, b) and:
   - lim f(x) = f(a) as x → a from the right
   - lim f(x) = f(b) as x → b from the left

========================
INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM
========================
Assume f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b].
Then f(x) will take on any value between f(a) and f(b).
For any L between f(a) and f(b), there exists at least one number c in [a, b] 
for which f(c) = L.

========================
HYPERBOLA
========================
Equation:
   (y^2)/(a^2) - (x^2)/(b^2) = 1, center = (0, 0)
   ((y - k)^2)/(a^2) - ((x - h)^2)/(b^2) = 1, center = (h, k)

NB: When y is positive, the graph opens upwards. 
    When x is positive, the graph opens sideways.

To graph a hyperbola:
1. Find the asymptotes by making y the subject in the hyperbola equation 
   and evaluating the result as x → ∞.
2. Determine if the graph opens upward or sideways.
3. Find the intersections on the axes.
4. Draw the hyperbola, ensuring it passes through the intersections 
   and never crosses the asymptotes.

Foci:
   f = √(a^2 + b^2), where f = focus and a, b are the denominators in the hyperbola equation.
   - When the graph opens toward the y-axis, the foci are at coordinates (0, ±f).
   - When the graph opens toward the x-axis, the foci are at coordinates (±f, 0).

========================
COMPLEX NUMBERS
========================
NB: Multiplying a complex number by another complex number will, depending on the value:
   - Shrink, enlarge, or maintain the modulus of the initial complex number 
     by the modulus of the multiplier.
   - Rotate the initial complex number by an amount equal to the argument of the multiplier.
