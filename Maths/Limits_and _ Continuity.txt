Limits describe how a function behaves near a point, instead of at the point.

Symbolic representation of the limit of a function:
lim f(x) = L (Read as : The limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L)
x → a

Notes:
1.When the numbers you use to determine the limit of a function increase towards the said number (x → a⁻), we call it Approaching from the Left.
2.When the numbers you use to determine the limit of a function decrease towards the said number (x → a⁺), we call it Approaching from the Right.
3.A function might be undefined at a point, but its limit can exist at that point.
4.The limit only exists if the right-hand limit and the left-hand limit both approach the same value.

Unbounded Limit:
This occurs when approaching the limit from both sides does not produce a finite value.
In such a situation, we say the limit does not exist.

Using Tables to Approximate Limit Values

Limits are tools for reasoning about function behavior, and tables are tools for reasoning about limits.

NB 1: When using a table to approximate limits, it is important to construct it in a way that simulates the feeling of getting "infinitely close" to a desired x-value.

NB 2: Sometimes the limit of a function is different from the actual value of the function at that point.

Properties of Limits:

Assume:
1. lim (f(x)) = L, as x → c
2. lim (g(x)) = M, as x → c

Rules:

1. Sum Rule:
   lim (f(x) + g(x)) = L + M, as x → c

2. Difference Rule:
   lim (f(x) - g(x)) = L - M, as x → c

3. Product Rule:
   lim (f(x) · g(x)) = L · M, as x → c

4. Constant Multiple Rule:
   lim (k · f(x)) = k · L, as x → c

5. Quotient Rule:
   lim (f(x) / g(x)) = L / M, as x → c
   (provided M ≠ 0)

6. Power Rule:
   lim (f(x))^(r/s) = (L)^(r/s), as x → c
   (where r and s are integers, s ≠ 0)


Limits of Composite Functions:

lim (f(g(x))) = f(lim (g(x))), as x → a
Only if:
1. lim (g(x)) = L exists, as x → a
2. f(L) is continuous

Note:
The limit of the internal function g(x) may not exist,
but the limit of the composite function f(g(x)) can still exist.
