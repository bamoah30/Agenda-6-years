Quotes:
1. "The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence." — Herman Weyl
2. "Mathematics requires a small dose, not of genius, but of an imaginative freedom 
   which in a larger dose would be insanity." — Angus K. Rodgers
3. "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself." — Morpheus
4. "Proofs involving matrices can be shortened by 50% if one throws the matrices out." — Emil Artin


Definition of Vector:
- Physicist: A vector is an arrow with length and direction which can be moved around in space.
- Computer Scientist: A vector is an ordered list of numbers.
- Mathematician: A vector is an element of a vector space, defined abstractly as an object that can be 
  added to other vectors and scaled by numbers (scalars), while obeying specific axioms such as 
  associativity, commutativity of addition, distributivity of scalar multiplication, and the existence 
  of a zero vector and additive inverses.


Definition of Basis of a Vector Space:
The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire space.
Thus, i, j, k are the basis vectors of the xyz coordinate system.


Note:
The span of vector_V and vector_W is the set of all their linear combinations:
    a(vector_V) + b(vector_W), where "a" and "b" vary over all real numbers.


NB:
When there are three vectors and two can be expressed as linear combinations of the other, 
we call the vectors linearly dependent.


Properties of Linear Transformation:
1. All lines must remain lines without being curved.
2. The origin remains fixed.


Formula:
Assume vector_V = -i + 2j
Transformed vector_V = -(Transformation of i) + 2(Transformation of j)


Technical Definition of Linear Transformation:
- Additivity: L(vector_V + vector_W) = L(vector_V) + L(vector_W)
- Scaling:    L(c * vector_V) = c * L(vector_V)


NB:
For shear, the transformation matrix is given by:
    [1   1]
    [0   1]
