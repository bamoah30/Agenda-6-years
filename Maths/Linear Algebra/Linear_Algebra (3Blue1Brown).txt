Quotes:
1. "The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence." — Herman Weyl
2. "Mathematics requires a small dose, not of genius, but of an imaginative freedom 
   which in a larger dose would be insanity." — Angus K. Rodgers
3. "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself." — Morpheus
4. "Proofs involving matrices can be shortened by 50% if one throws the matrices out." — Emil Artin


Definition of Vector:
- Physicist: A vector is an arrow with length and direction which can be moved around in space.
- Computer Scientist: A vector is an ordered list of numbers.
- Mathematician: A vector is an element of a vector space, defined abstractly as an object that can be 
  added to other vectors and scaled by numbers (scalars), while obeying specific axioms such as 
  associativity, commutativity of addition, distributivity of scalar multiplication, and the existence 
  of a zero vector and additive inverses.


Definition of Basis of a Vector Space:
The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire space.
Thus, i, j, k are the basis vectors of the xyz coordinate system.


Note:
The span of vector_V and vector_W is the set of all their linear combinations:
    a(vector_V) + b(vector_W), where "a" and "b" vary over all real numbers.


NB:
When there are three vectors and two can be expressed as linear combinations of the other, 
we call the vectors linearly dependent.


Properties of Linear Transformation:
1. All lines must remain lines without being curved.
2. The origin remains fixed.


Formula:
Assume vector_V = -i + 2j
Transformed vector_V = -(Transformation of i) + 2(Transformation of j)


Technical Definition of Linear Transformation:
- Additivity: L(vector_V + vector_W) = L(vector_V) + L(vector_W)
- Scaling:    L(c * vector_V) = c * L(vector_V)


NB:
For shear, the transformation matrix is given by:
    [1   1]
    [0   1]

DETERMINANT
Definition: The determinant is the scaling factor by which an area (2D) or volume (3D) is transformed.
Notes:
- Negative determinant → space is flipped (orientation reversed).
- In 3D, determinant measures expansion or compression of volume.
- det(M1 * M2) = det(M1) * det(M2)

Transformations:
- 90° Anti-Clockwise Rotation:
  [0 -1]
  [1  0]

- 90° Clockwise Rotation:
  [0  1]
  [-1 0]

- Rightward Shear:
  [1 1]
  [0 1]

- Leftward Shear:
  [1 -1]
  [0  1]

------------------------------------------------------------

COLUMN SPACE
Definition: The set of all possible outputs A*v (for vector v) is called the column space of matrix A.
Represents the span of the columns of A.

NULL SPACE / KERNEL
Definition: The set of all vectors v such that A*v = 0.
Geometrically, it represents directions that collapse to the origin under transformation.

------------------------------------------------------------

RANK
Definition: The number of dimensions in the column space (dimension of the output space).
Examples:
- Rank 1 → Transformation collapses to a line (determinant = 0).
- Rank 2 → Transformation spans a plane (non-zero determinant).

Notes:
- Number of columns = number of basis vectors.
- Number of rows = number of landing spots (output coordinates).

------------------------------------------------------------

DOT PRODUCT
Properties:
1. Positive if vectors point in similar directions.
2. Zero if vectors are perpendicular.
3. Negative if vectors point in opposite directions.

------------------------------------------------------------

DUALITY
Idea: Many concepts in linear algebra have dual interpretations (e.g., row space vs. column space).

------------------------------------------------------------

CROSS PRODUCT
Definition:
v × w = Area of parallelogram formed by v and w

Properties:
- v × w = -(w × v)
- Magnitude = ||v|| * ||w|| * sinθ
- Direction is perpendicular to both v and w (right-hand rule)

Facts:
1. v · (v × w) = 0
2. w · (v × w) = 0
3. θ = arccos( (v · w) / (||v|| * ||w||) )
4. ||v × w|| = ||v|| * ||w|| * sinθ

------------------------------------------------------------

COORDINATE SYSTEMS
A coordinate system translates between vectors and numbers.
Linear transformations can be viewed as dot products in different bases.

------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGE OF BASIS
Analogy: Like translating languages.
Geometrically: switching from "our grid" to "another grid."
Numerically: converting coordinates between bases.

Steps:
1. Start with a vector in another basis.
2. Convert it into your basis.
3. Apply the transformation in your basis.
4. Translate back using the inverse of the basis change.

Expression A^(-1) M A:
- M = transformation
- A^(-1), A = change of basis (empathy/shift)

------------------------------------------------------------

EIGENVECTORS & EIGENVALUES
Definitions:
- Eigenvectors: Vectors that remain on their span during transformation.
- Eigenvalues: Scalars describing how much eigenvectors are stretched or squished.

Equation:
A v = λ v
where A = transformation matrix, v = eigenvector, λ = eigenvalue

Notes:
- In 3D, eigenvectors can represent axes of rotation.
- Imaginary eigenvalues → no real eigenvectors (rotation-like behavior).
- Derivatives are linear operators, hence connected to eigen-analysis.
