MATRIX DEFINITIONS

1. A rectangular array of numbers or symbols is called a matrix.
2. The numbers or symbols in a matrix are called entries.
3. The sequence of all entries on a horizontal line is called a row.
4. The set of all entries on a vertical line is called a column.
5. The entry in the i-th row and the j-th column is in the (i, j) position.
6. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m × n matrix.
7. A 1 × n matrix is called a row matrix or row vector.
8. An m × 1 matrix is called a column matrix or column vector.
9. A matrix with the same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix.
10. If the number of columns in matrix A is equal to the number of rows in matrix B, then A is said to be conformable with respect to B.
11. A square matrix in which all non-diagonal entries are zero is called a diagonal matrix.
12. An n × n diagonal matrix with every diagonal entry equal to 1 is called the n × n identity matrix, denoted by Iₙ.

MATRIX REPRESENTATION OF A SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS

The system of equations:
2x − 3y + 4z = 0
x + y + z = 6

can be written in matrix form as:
Ax = b

where A is the coefficient matrix:
[ 2  -3   4 ]
[ 1   1   1 ]

and x and b are column vectors given by:
x = [ x ]      b = [ 0 ]
    [ y ]          [ 6 ]
    [ z ]

NOTE:
(AB)ᵀ = BᵀAᵀ
