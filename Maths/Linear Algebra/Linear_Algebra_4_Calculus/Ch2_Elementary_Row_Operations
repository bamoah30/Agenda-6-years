ELEMENTARY ROW OPERATIONS

The corresponding operations performed on the rows of an augmented matrix are called elementary row operations.

Types of Elementary Row Operations:

1. Type 1 (Row Interchange)

   - Interchange two equations.
   - Equivalent matrix operation: interchange two rows.

2. Type 2 (Row Scaling)

   - Multiply one equation by a non-zero number.
   - Equivalent matrix operation: multiply one row by a non-zero scalar.

3. Type 3 (Row Replacement)

   - Replace one equation by itself plus a scalar multiple of another equation.
   - Equivalent matrix operation: replace one row by itself plus a scalar multiple of another row.

NOTE ON EQUIVALENT SYSTEMS

When two systems of linear equations have the same solution set, the systems are said to be equivalent.

ROW REDUCTION METHOD (GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION)

Description:

1. Write the augmented matrix [A | b] corresponding to the given system of linear equations.
2. Use elementary row operations to transform [A | b] into its row-reduced echelon form [A₀ | b₀].
3. Solve the system corresponding to the augmented matrix [A₀ | b₀].

ROW-REDUCED ECHELON FORM (RREF)

A non-zero m × n matrix is in row-reduced echelon form if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. In each row, the first non-zero entry (if any) is 1. This entry is called a pivot.

   - If the first non-zero entry is not 1, use a Type 2 row operation to make it 1.

2. In any column containing a pivot, all other entries in that column are zero.

   - If this condition is not met, use a Type 3 row operation to create zeros.

3. If there are r non-zero rows (1 ≤ r ≤ m), all zero rows must appear below the non-zero rows.

   - If zero rows appear above non-zero rows, use a Type 1 row operation to reorder the rows.

4. Each pivot must appear to the right of the pivot in the row above it.

   - If this condition is violated, use a Type 1 row operation to reposition the rows appropriately.
