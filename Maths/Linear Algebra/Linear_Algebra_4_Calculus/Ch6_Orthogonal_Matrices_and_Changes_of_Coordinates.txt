ORTHOGONAL MATRICES

DEFINITION

An n × n invertible matrix Q is called an orthogonal matrix if and only if:
Q⁻¹ = Qᵀ

COLUMN RELATIONS OF AN ORTHOGONAL MATRIX

Let q₁ and q₂ denote the first and second columns of an orthogonal matrix Q.

Relation 1 (Unit Length):
q₁ᵀq₁ = 1 and q₂ᵀq₂ = 1  
Each column has unit length.

Relation 2 (Orthogonality):
q₁ᵀq₂ = q₂ᵀq₁ = 0  
Each column is orthogonal to every other column.

NOTE:
• These column relations hold for every orthogonal matrix.
• A non-orthogonal matrix fails to satisfy at least one of these relations.

THEOREM 1

A matrix is orthogonal if and only if each column has unit length and each column is orthogonal to every other column.

LINEAR COMBINATIONS AND LINEAR INDEPENDENCE

DEFINITION 2 (Linear Combination)

In ℝⁿ, if {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ} is a set of vectors, then a vector of the form:
n₁a₁ + n₂a₂ + ... + nₖaₖ

is called a linear combination of {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ}, where each nᵢ (i = 1, 2, ..., k) is a real number.

DEFINITION 3 (Linear Independence)

In ℝⁿ, a set of vectors {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ} is said to be linearly independent if the only linear combination that equals the zero vector is:
n₁a₁ + n₂a₂ + ... + nₖaₖ = 0

if and only if:
n₁ = n₂ = ... = nₖ = 0

DEFINITION 4 (Span)

If {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ} is a linearly independent set of k vectors in ℝⁿ, then the set of all their linear combinations forms a k-dimensional vector space V, called the span of {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ}.

NOTE:
• A vector b belongs to V if and only if:
  b = n₁a₁ + n₂a₂ + ... + nₖaₖ
  where each nᵢ (i = 1, 2, ..., k) is a real number.
