ORTHOGONAL MATRICES

DEFINITION

An n × n invertible matrix Q is called an orthogonal matrix if and only if:
Q⁻¹ = Qᵀ

COLUMN RELATIONS OF AN ORTHOGONAL MATRIX

Let q₁ and q₂ denote the first and second columns of an orthogonal matrix Q.

Relation 1 (Unit Length):
q₁ᵀq₁ = 1 and q₂ᵀq₂ = 1  
Each column has unit length.

Relation 2 (Orthogonality):
q₁ᵀq₂ = q₂ᵀq₁ = 0  
Each column is orthogonal to every other column.

NOTE:
• These column relations hold for every orthogonal matrix.
• A non-orthogonal matrix fails to satisfy at least one of these relations.

THEOREM 1

A matrix is orthogonal if and only if each column has unit length and each column is orthogonal to every other column.

LINEAR COMBINATIONS AND LINEAR INDEPENDENCE

DEFINITION 2 (Linear Combination)

In ℝⁿ, if {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ} is a set of vectors, then a vector of the form:
n₁a₁ + n₂a₂ + ... + nₖaₖ

is called a linear combination of {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ}, where each nᵢ (i = 1, 2, ..., k) is a real number.

DEFINITION 3 (Linear Independence)

In ℝⁿ, a set of vectors {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ} is said to be linearly independent if the only linear combination that equals the zero vector is:
n₁a₁ + n₂a₂ + ... + nₖaₖ = 0

if and only if:
n₁ = n₂ = ... = nₖ = 0

DEFINITION 4 (Span)

If {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ} is a linearly independent set of k vectors in ℝⁿ, then the set of all their linear combinations forms a k-dimensional vector space V, called the span of {a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ}.

NOTE:
• A vector b belongs to V if and only if:
  b = n₁a₁ + n₂a₂ + ... + nₖaₖ
  where each nᵢ (i = 1, 2, ..., k) is a real number.

CHANGE OF BASIS AND ORTHOGONAL TRANSFORMATIONS

DEFINITION 5 (Change of Basis Matrix)

If {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ} is a basis for ℝⁿ, let A be the matrix whose j-th column
(j = 1, 2, ..., n) is the coordinate column of aⱼ with respect to the standard
basis of ℝⁿ.

Then A is called the change-of-basis matrix from the standard basis to
{a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ}.

CHANGE OF COORDINATES

Let:
• v be the coordinate column of a point P with respect to the standard basis,
• v′ be the coordinate column of P with respect to the new basis
  {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ}.

Then:
v = Av′   expresses the old (standard) coordinates of P in terms of the new
         coordinates.

v′ = A⁻¹v expresses the new coordinates of P in terms of the old
          (standard) coordinates.

CHANGES OF COORDINATES WITH ORTHOGONAL MATRICES

NOTE:
• To change the basis in ℝⁿ, we need n linearly independent vectors.

THEOREM 2

Any orthonormal set of k vectors {u₁, u₂, ..., uₖ} in ℝⁿ is linearly independent.
Therefore, any orthonormal set of n vectors in ℝⁿ forms a basis for ℝⁿ.

DEFINITION 6 (Rotation Matrix)

An n × n orthogonal matrix Q with det(Q) = 1 is called a rotation matrix and
corresponds to a rotation of the coordinate axes.

The columns of Q = [q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ] have the same orientation (relative
positions) as the columns of the identity matrix:
I = [e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ].

An orthogonal matrix Q with det(Q) = −1 corresponds to a rotation combined with
a reflection of the coordinate axes. In this case, the columns of Q have the
opposite orientation to those of the identity matrix.

For n = 3:
• The columns of a rotation matrix form a right-handed set of vectors.
• If det(Q) = −1, the columns form a left-handed set of vectors.

DOT PRODUCT UNDER ORTHOGONAL TRANSFORMATIONS

Let Q be an orthogonal matrix.
If two points have coordinate columns v and w with respect to the standard
basis, and coordinate columns v′ and w′ with respect to the new basis, then:

v = Qv′   and   w = Qw′

The dot product of v and w is preserved:
v · w = vᵀw
      = (Qv′)ᵀ(Qw′)
      = v′ᵀQᵀQw′
      = v′ᵀw′

since Qᵀ = Q⁻¹.
