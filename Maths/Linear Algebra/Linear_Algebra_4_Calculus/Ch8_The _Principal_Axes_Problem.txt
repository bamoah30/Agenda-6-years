Consider the equation: 
    ax^2 + 2bxy + cy^2 + f = 0
-The equation represents a conic section curve centered at the origin
- x and y axes are not the principal axes of the curve if b is non-zero.

Standard forms if b = 0
1. x^2 + y^2 = r^2 ( a circle with radius r)
2. x^2/p^2 + y^2/q^2 = 1 (an ellipse with semi-axes lengths p and q)
3. x^2/p^2 - y^2/q^2 = 1 (hyperbola with asymptotes y = +- q/p x)

Theorem 1:
If the diagonal elements of the matrix D are the eigenvalues of the matrix A, and the columns of the matrix Q are chosen to be the corresponding unit lenght mutually orthogonal eigenvectors of A, then
Q^T AQ = D and Q is an orthogonal matrix.

Summary for Solving the Pricipal Axes Problem:
1.Find the symmetric matrix A of the quadratic form in v for the equation
NB : v is the cordiabte and  A  is obtained by 
    -Filling the diagonal with the coeffiecient of the highest power terms.
    -Half the terms contianing the multiple of the variables to fill the remainig spaces

2.Solve the eigenvalue problem for A 
3.Write the new equation in V`. The eigne values of A are coefficients in the new quadratic form in V`.
4.Sketch the principal axes. The eigenvectors lie along the positive principal axes.
5. Find the matrix Q with det Q = 1 whose columns are eigenvectors of unit lenght.
Nb If you obtained an orthogonal matrix with determinant -1 you can multiply the first column by -1 to obtain a rotation matrix.
