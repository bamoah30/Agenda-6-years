DETERMINANTS

1. Determinant of a Matrix

The determinant is defined only for square matrices.

If det(A) ≠ 0, the corresponding system of linear equations has a unique solution.

If det(A) = 0, the system either:

* has no solution (inconsistent system), or
* has infinitely many solutions (consistent system with rank less than the number of unknowns).

2. Method of Laplace Expansion

Minor:
The minor of an element is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by deleting the row and column containing that element.

Cofactor:
The cofactor of an element is defined as:
C_ij = (−1)^(i+j) multiplied by the minor of the element.

Laplace Expansion Procedure:
Select any row or column along which to expand.
For each element in the selected row or column, multiply the element by its corresponding cofactor.
The determinant of the matrix is the sum of these products.

3. Method of Row Reduction to Triangular Form

A triangular matrix is a square matrix in which all elements below or above the main diagonal are zero.

Theorem 1:
The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.

Theorem 2:
If two rows of matrix A are interchanged to produce matrix B, then:
det(B) = −det(A)

Theorem 3:
If one row of matrix A is multiplied by a scalar r to produce matrix B, then:
det(B) = r · det(A)

Theorem 4:
If matrix B is obtained from matrix A by replacing one row with that row plus a multiple of another row, then:
det(B) = det(A)

4. Additional Properties of Determinants

Let A and B be n x n matrices, and let A^T denote the transpose of A.

1. If A has a zero row or a zero column, then det(A) = 0
2. If any row or column of A is a multiple of another row or column, then det(A) = 0
3. det(AB) = det(A) det(B)
4. det(A^T) = det(A)
