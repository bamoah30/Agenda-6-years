TRACE
Definition:
If A is an n × n matrix, the trace of A (denoted Tr(A)) is defined as the sum of its diagonal entries.
Tr(A) = a_11 + a_22 + ... + a_nn

------------------------------------------------------------

SYMMETRIC MATRICES
Definition:
An n × n matrix A is symmetric if A^T = A, i.e., a_ij = a_ji for all i, j = 1, ..., n.

------------------------------------------------------------

THEOREM 1
If A is a symmetric n × n matrix, and λ1 ≠ λ2 are two distinct eigenvalues,
then the corresponding eigenvectors v1 and v2 are orthogonal:
v1 · v2 = 0

------------------------------------------------------------

THEOREM 2
Every symmetric n × n matrix has n mutually orthogonal eigenvectors.

------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE
In general, n × n matrices with n mutually orthogonal eigenvectors are called normal matrices.
