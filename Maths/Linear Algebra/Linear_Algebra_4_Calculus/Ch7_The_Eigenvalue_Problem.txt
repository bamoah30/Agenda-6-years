In general, if A is n x n matrix, the trace of A (denoted by TrA) is defined to be the sum of its diagonal terms.

An n x n matrix A is symmetrical if A_T = A or a_ij = a_ji, for all i,j = 1, ..., n

Theorem 1: If A is a symmetric n x n matrix ʎ_1 != ʎ_2 are two distinct eigenvalues, and if v_1 and v_2 are corresponding eigenvectors then v_1 dot v_2 = 0

Theorem 2: Every n x n symmetric matrix has n mutually orthogonal eigenvectors.

NB: In general, n x n matrices with n mutually orthogonal eigenvectors are called normal matrices
