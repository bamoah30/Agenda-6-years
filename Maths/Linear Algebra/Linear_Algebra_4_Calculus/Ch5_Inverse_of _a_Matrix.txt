INVERSE OF A MATRIX

INVERSE OF REAL NUMBERS

Two real numbers a and b are inverses of each other if:
ab = 1

NOTE:
• Zero is the only real number that does not have an inverse.

BASIC FACTS ABOUT MATRIX INVERSES

• At the basic level, the inverse of a matrix is defined only for square matrices.
• Non-square matrices can possess only one-sided inverses.

DEFINITION OF MATRIX INVERSE

Two n × n matrices A and B are said to be inverses of each other if and only if:
AB = BA = Iₙ

NOTE:
• Not every square matrix has an inverse.
• A matrix with at least one zero row or zero column has no inverse.

THEOREMS ON MATRIX INVERSES

Theorem 1:
An n × n matrix A has an inverse A⁻¹ if and only if:
det(A) ≠ 0

NOTE:
• A matrix that has an inverse is called a nonsingular matrix.
• A matrix that does not have an inverse is called a singular matrix.

Theorem 2:
If det(A) ≠ 0, then the row-reduced echelon form of the augmented matrix [A | Iₙ] is:
[Iₙ | A⁻¹]

NOTE:
• When A is invertible, its row-reduced echelon form is Iₙ.
• Therefore, an invertible matrix has rank n.

ADJOINT (ADJUGATE) MATRIX METHOD

The adjoint method is another method for finding the inverse of a matrix.

If A is an n × n matrix, the adjoint of A is constructed by:
1. Finding all n² cofactors of A.
2. Arranging these cofactors into a cofactor matrix.
3. Transposing the cofactor matrix.

NOTE:
• The resulting matrix is called the adjoint of A and is denoted by adj(A).

Theorem 3:
If det(A) ≠ 0, then:
A⁻¹ = (1 / det(A)) · adj(A)

NOTE:
• The row-reduction method is generally preferred for computing matrix inverses.
• The adjoint method is mainly useful for theoretical purposes.

THEOREM 4 (CRAMER'S RULE)

Let Ax = b be a linear system where:
• A is an n × n invertible coefficient matrix,
• x = (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)ᵀ,
• b is a column vector.

Let Nᵢ be the n × n matrix obtained by replacing the i-th column of A with the vector b,
while leaving all other columns unchanged, for i = 1, 2, ..., n.

Then the components of x are given by:
xᵢ = det(Nᵢ) / det(A),   for i = 1, 2, ..., n
