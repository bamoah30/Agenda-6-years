A polynomial is an expression that consists of a sum of terms containing integer powers of x

A rational expression is a fraction whose numerator and denominator are polynomials

Domain of an expression is the set of all input values for which the expression is defined.

To find the behaviour of a rational expression as it approaches infinity either from the right hand side or the left hand side:

1. Divide each term by the highest power of x in the numerator
2. Evaluate the resulting terms as x approaches infinity
3. Conclude from your results

Or
Consider only the terms with the highest powers and make deductions from there

Removable discontinuity occurs when a factor causing the expression to ne undefined can be cancelled, leaving a hole in the graph.
It is the undefined values of x that vanishes after reducing the rational expression

A zero of a rational expression can be determined when you set the numerator of the simplified expression equal to zero and solve for x.

Vertical asymptote occurs at values that make the denominator of the simplified expression equals zero and the reduced rational expression undefined.

Horizontal Asymptote: What the function approaches as x approaches infinitiy and as x approaches negative infinity
