A polynomial is an expression that consists of a sum of terms containing interger powers of x

A rational expression is a fraction whose numerator and denominator are polynomials

Domain of an expression is the set of all possible input values thst makes the function defined.

To find the behaviour of a rational expression as it approaches infinity either from the right hand side or the left hand side:

1. Divide each term by the highest power of x in the numerator
2. Evaluate the resulting terms as x approaches infinity
3. Conclude from your results

Or
COnsider only the terms with the highest powers and maked deductions from there

Removal Continuity occurs when the restrcited domain can be cancelled out of the rational expression.
It is the undefined values of x that vanishes after reducing the rational expression

A zero of a rational expression can be determine when you find the values of x of the reduced rational expression's numerator equals zero

Vertical asymptote occurs at values that makes the reduced rational expression undefined.

Horizontal Aymptote: what does the fucntion approaches as x approaches infintiy and as x approaches negative infinity
