===============================
Properties of Logarithm Functions
===============================
1. log(A^B) = B · log(A)
2. log(A) + log(B) = log(AB)
3. log(A) - log(B) = log(A/B)

===============================
Change of Base Formula
===============================
log_a(B) = C
= (log_x(B)) / (log_x(a)) = C

NB: When the base of the log is e, the logarithm is called the natural log (ln).

===============================
Exponential and Logarithmic Relation
===============================
a^b = C
⇔ log_a(C) = b


NB: The logarithm of any negative number does not exist.

Derivatives of Logarithmic and Exponential Functions
----------------------------------------------------

1. [e^u]'      = e^u * u'

2. [a^u]'      = a^u * u' * ln(a)

3. [ln(u)]'    = u' / u

4. NB: [ln(ax)]' = 1 / x   (where a is a constant)

5. [ln(x)^a]'  = a / x

6. [log_a(u)]' = u' / (u * ln(a))

LOGARITHMS

Definition:
A logarithm is a function that gives the exponent to which a fixed number (the base)
must be raised to produce a given number (the argument).

Types of Logarithms:
1. Common logarithm:
   log₁₀(x) = log(x)

2. Natural logarithm:
   logₑ(x) = ln(x)

General Rules for log_b(x):
1. x > 0
2. b > 0 and b ≠ 1

Applications of Logarithms:
1. Used to analyze very small or very large numbers.
2. Logarithmic scales are often used when graphing data with a wide spread.

Note:
On logarithmic scales → Equal distance corresponds to equal ratio.

LOGARITHMIC SCALE DIAGRAM (TEXT VERSION)

|----|---------|---------|---------|
  1     10       100      1000

Explanation:
- Each tick mark represents a power of 10.
- The spacing between 1 and 10 is the same as between 10 and 100, and 100 to 1000.
- This is because each step increases by a factor of 10 (not by addition).

Why It Matters:
- Log scales compress large ranges into manageable space.
- Useful for visualizing exponential growth, sound intensity, pH levels, etc.
- Makes multiplicative relationships easier to interpret.

Key Insight:
Equal distance → Equal ratio
