To determine the inverse of a matrix:

1. Find the determinant of the matrix
2. FInd the adjunct of the matrix
   NB: The adjunct of the matrix is the found by first rotating the main diagonal 180 degrees.
   Then negating the other diagonal.
3. The multiple the adjunct with the reciprocal of the determinant.
