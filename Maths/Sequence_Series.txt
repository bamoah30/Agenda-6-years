Finite Geometric Series:

The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is:

Sₙ = [a(1 - rⁿ)] / (1 - r)

Where:
Sₙ = Sum of the first n terms of the series
a  = First term in the series
r  = Common ratio of the series
n  = Number of terms in the series

NB: The sum of a sequence is termed a *series*.

Mortgage Loan Formula:
L = P * ((r - r^(n+1)) / (1 - r))

Where:
L = loan
P = monthly payment
r = monthly interest rate
n = number of months required to fully pay the loan

Binomial Theorem:
(a + b)^n = Σ (from k = 0 to n) [ C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k ]

Where:
C(n, k) = "n choose k" = n! / (k!(n-k)!)


Trick for Finding the Coefficient in Binomial Expansion:

Coefficient of the next term =
   (Exponent of the first variable in the previous term × Coefficient of the previous term)/ (Term number of the previous term)
