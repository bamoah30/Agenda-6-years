Consider the A and B are events
The probability of either event A or event B occurring is given by the formula: 
 P(A or B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) [Addition Rule]

Mutually Exclusive Events are events that do not occur at the same time
For Mutaully excluisve events, P(A and B) = 0

Independent events are events that the ouccurrnace of on event has any influence on the other event.
For independent events the probability of getting some events in a sample space is the multiplication of the their individual probabilities.

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) [Multiplication Rule]
