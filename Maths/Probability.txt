Consider A and B are events
The probability of either event A or event B occurring is given by the formula:
P(A or B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) [Addition Rule]

Mutually Exclusive Events are events that do not occur at the same time
For Mutaully excluisve events, P(A and B) = 0

Independent events are events that the ouccurrnace of on event has any influence on the other event.
For independent events the probability of getting some events in a sample space is the multiplication of the their individual probabilities.

P(A and B) = P(A) \* P(B) [Multiplication Rule]

Permutation  
P(n,r) = nPr = n! / (n-r)!

Combination
When the order does not matter, we use combinations.

nCr = nPr / r!

The trick in solving probability with Permutation and Combination is to identify if order ir relevant or not in the question.
If order matters, use permutation and combination otherwise

Qualities of a Valid Probability Model:

1. The sum of all the probabilty should sum up to 1 or 100%
2. Probability cannot be a negative number

Expected Value / Mean

The expected value is the average outcome of an experiment when repeated many times.
It represents the long-run behavior of a random variable by weighting each possible
result with its probability.

Discrete Random Variable Formula:
E(X) = Σ [ x_i * P(x_i) ]
where x_i are the possible outcomes and P(x_i) is the probability of each outcome.
