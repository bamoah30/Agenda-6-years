Reflection
- What went well: Operated the Cartoner machine for the full working hours and still felt motivated to do more after closing
- What was challenging: Struggled to allocate enough time for my study roadmaps
- Strategy: Rotate the roadmaps as follows:
  1. Mathematics compulsory from Monday to Friday, with review on weekends
  2. Projects compulsory throughout the week
  3. AI roadmap on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with revision on Sundays
  4. Robotics roadmap on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with revision on Saturdays
- Tomorrow's focus: Surpass today’s production record and conclude the lessons on robot anatomy
