- What was challenging: Still finding it hard to allocate enough time for my roadmaps
- Strategy: Rotate the roadmaps as follows:
  1. Mathematics compulsory from Monday to Friday, with review on weekends
  2. Projects compulsory throughout the week
  3. AI roadmap on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with revision on Sundays
  4. Robotics roadmap on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with revision on Saturdays
- Tomorrow's focus: Beat today's production record, conclude the lessons on robot anatomy
