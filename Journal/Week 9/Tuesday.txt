Journal Entry – December 2, 2025 | Week 9, Day 2

Robotics Roadmap
- Topic studied: Robot Configuration and Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
- Key takeaway: Gruebler's criteria is used for determining the DOF of a structure. Articulated configuration is the most dexterous configuration
- Opinion: Happy to see that the Gruebler's criteria I learned in Dynamics is applied here
- Time spent: 45 minutes

Professional Development
- Activities: Work at Peace Indo
- Outcome: Helped change the belt for the main production line gearbox and motor
- Decision: Started keeping logs on technical elements I encounter

---

Reflection
- What went well: Made progress with regards to robotics
- What was challenging: The timing for each roadmap was not enough; I was too engaged with social media content that distracted me even when I was off
- Strategy: Starting next week, rotate each roadmap (a day for one roadmap), dedicate 30 minutes before studies, and avoid all social media content
- Tomorrow's focus: Tackle the time and datetime modules in AI, continue with exponential and logarithmic functions in mathematics
