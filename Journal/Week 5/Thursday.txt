Journal Entry – November 6, 2025

Today, as usual, I woke up at 4:30 a.m. and began preparing for my interview with Peace Indo (Medisoft). 
I took time to learn about the company and their products. 
I also generated some potential questions and answers using Claude AI and reviewed them to get a sense of what I might be facing.

During the interview, I realized I needed to do more practical studies. 
I struggled with simple questions, such as distinguishing between safety, precautions, and safety precautions. 
Honestly, I didn’t know there was a difference until today. I learned something new.

I blanked out when asked to name types of pumps—only managed to name one.

After the interview, I came to understand that having a certificate alone isn’t enough to thrive in the corporate world. 
I still have a long way to go. But when I’m given the chance, 
I will learn relentlessly to become the best version of myself.

I returned home a bit exhausted, rested for a while, 
then switched over to watch the National Science and Maths Quiz featuring my alma mater, Mfantsipim School, alongside Opoku Ware School and St. Augustine’s College.
 Mfantsipim won with 56 points, followed by Augustine’s with 42 points, and Opoku Ware with 29 points.
During the contest, I learned how DNA matching is done, and that mercury is non-degradable, among other things.

Tomorrow, I have another interview for a role as an equipment service technician. 
I hope it goes well. 
But today’s interview with Peace Indo gave me a glimpse into how taking a job unrelated to my AI and Robotics Engineering journey could negatively impact my dreams. 
After tomorrow’s interview, I will only apply to roles aligned with my goals.

Though, I wasn't able to make any forward movement with my AI and Robotics Engineer journey, I pray to return back to it as soon as possible.

Life is short, and I believe it’s better to live it doing what you love than to live it otherwise.
