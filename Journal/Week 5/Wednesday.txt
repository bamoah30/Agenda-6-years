Journal Entry – November 5, 2025

Today marked my first deep dive into debugging with Automate the Boring Stuff.  
I explored key concepts like Tracebacks, understood the Call Stack, 
and wrapped up today's AI learning journey with Assertions—a solid foundation for error handling in Python.

Later in the morning, I applied for three technician roles:
- Mechanical Technician  
- Equipment Maintenance Technician  
- Vehicle Body Specialist  

I received two interview invitations almost immediately—one scheduled for Thursday (tomorrow)
and the other for Friday. I quickly adjusted my schedule to prioritize preparation for the first interview.

After reorganizing my day, I resumed my math studies on Khan Academy. 
I began studying Conic Sections module and completed all lessons on Ellipses. 
Tomorrow, I plan to tackle Parabolas.

From my Robotics roadmap, 
I started learning Electrical Circuits. Out of 58 videos in the YouTube playlist, 
I watched and fully grasped 11—steady progress.

On my first portfolio project, I completed and tested the Analyzer Module of my AI Data Analyzer project. 
I ran standalone tests and integrated it with other Phase 2 modules for system-level validation.

If tomorrow’s interview doesn’t take too much time, 
I’ll return to my learning roadmaps and also begin Phase 3 of the AI Data Analyzer.
