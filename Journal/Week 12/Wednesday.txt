Journal Entry – December 24, 2025
Week 12, Day 3
==================================================

AI ROADMAP
--------------------------------------------------
Topic:
- Manipulating Images

Progress:
- Rotating and flipping images

Next Step:
- Manipulating individual pixels

Key Takeaway:
- The rotate() method includes an optional `expand` parameter which,
  when set to True, resizes the image to fully contain the rotated output

Time Spent:
- 45 minutes


ROBOTICS ROADMAP
--------------------------------------------------
Topic Studied:
- None recorded

Progress:
- No progress recorded

Next Step:
- Watch the third video on Electricity and Magnetism

Key Takeaway:
- None recorded

Time Spent:
- Not recorded


MATHEMATICS ROADMAP
--------------------------------------------------
Topic Studied:
- Inverse of a Matrix

Progress:
- Completed Chapter 5 of "Linear Algebra for Calculus"

Next Step:
- Begin Chapter 6

Key Takeaway:
- A matrix with determinant equal to zero has no inverse and is called
  a singular matrix; otherwise, it is called a nonsingular matrix

Time Spent:
- 55 minutes


PROJECTS
--------------------------------------------------
Project:
- None active

Work Completed:
- None

Blockers / Next Steps:
- Explore datasets on Kaggle as preparation for the next project

Time Spent:
- Not recorded


PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------------------
Activity:
- Phone call with the Operations Manager at Peace Indo

Outcome:
- Received assurance of continued employment next year


REFLECTION
--------------------------------------------------
Challenges:
- Difficulty staying on budget when shopping with an elderly companion

Solutions / Adjustments:
- Handle personal shopping independently to maintain budget discipline

Timeline Check:
- Ahead on Mathematics roadmap
- On track with AI roadmap
- Ahead on portfolio project planning
- On track with Robotics roadmap

Tomorrow’s Focus:
1. Complete Chapter 6 of "Linear Algebra for Calculus"
2. Finish the remaining videos on Electricity and Magnetism
3. Complete the lesson on image manipulation
