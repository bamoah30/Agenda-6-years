REFLECTION

Contextual Note:
- December 25 is a public holiday in Ghana. I used the opportunity
  to travel from Tema to Half-Assini Newtown to visit my parents.
  The journey began at 4:00 a.m. and ended at 7:30 p.m.
  The long travel duration caused physical fatigue.

Challenges:
- Traveling for approximately 15 hours

Solutions / Adjustments:
- Plan to recover lost productivity by creating a structured
  schedule for the following day

Timeline Check:
- On track with AI roadmap
- Ahead on Mathematics roadmap
- Ahead on portfolio project planning
- On track with Robotics roadmap

Tomorrow’s Focus:
1. Complete Chapter 6 of "Linear Algebra for Calculus"
2. Finish "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"
3. Complete remaining videos on Electricity and Magnetism
