Journal Entry – November 2, 2025

Today was a relatively quiet day.  
I woke up at 4:30 am—my body seems to have adjusted to that time.

By 5:00 am, I began reviewing the week’s work.  
I made a few minor corrections and pushed the updates to GitHub.

I took plenty of rest throughout the day.

After waking up, I revised my weekday schedule for the coming weeks to include dedicated time for Robotics, Mathematics, and job applications.  
I also added extra reading periods to my weekend routine.  
These sessions will be used to explore new material such as novels and self-improvement books.  
I’ve included time for reading research papers as well.

I’m hopeful that the coming weeks will be more productive than the past ones.  
Bless up.
