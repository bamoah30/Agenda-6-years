Journal Entry – November 23, 2025 | Week 7, Day 7

Morning
- Wake-up time: 4:00 am
- Morning routine: Quiet time

---

AI Roadmap
- Topic studied: Handling Word documents
- Key learning: Printing the content of Word documents, styling paragraphs and characters, customizing styles
- Challenge/blocker: The final document after customizing styles is not producing any output. Will work on that first thing after quiet time
- Time spent: 2 hours

---

Robotics Roadmap
- Topic studied: Diodes
- Concepts applied: Solved tutorial exercises
- Key takeaway: When voltage exceeds the threshold voltage of a reverse-biased diode, the diode acts as a conductor
- Time spent: 1.5 hours

---

Mathematics Roadmap
- Topic: Binomial Theorem
- Progress: Started Lesson 3 of Unit 9 in Khan Academy Precalculus
- Time spent: 1 hour

---

Projects
- Project: SQL Query Dashboard
- Work completed: Phase 2 completed
- Decisions made: Separated the GUI script from the backend logic to make error handling easier
- Blockers/next steps: Begin work on Phase 3
- Time spent: 1 hour

---

Reflection
- What went well: Made progress toward my goal
- What was challenging: Did not factor in time for family, so had to compromise on my schedule
- Key insight: Be very mindful of the company you keep. Energy is infectious
- Tomorrow's focus: Complete the lesson on Word document handling and conclude the tutorials on diodes
