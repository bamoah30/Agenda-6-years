Reflection

- What went well: Made progress towards my dreams, learnt new things at Peace Indo
- What was challenging: We were able to remove only two of four very tight bolts and nuts at the base of the machine. It was extremely exhausting.
- Key insight: When you are in the process of becoming your ideal self, your brain or self might trick you to assume you've already become that and then entice your ego to come into play. Review yourself always to check ego at play.
- Tomorrow's focus: Start with Phase 1 of my project, learn how to change the sachet in the packing machinery.
