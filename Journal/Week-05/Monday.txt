Journal Entry – November 3, 2025

As usual, I woke up earlier than 4:30 a.m. but didn’t move an inch. I stayed in bed until it was exactly 4:30 before shifting from my bed to my study table.
I reviewed my daily schedule and spent some quiet time in reflection.

At 5:00 a.m., I resumed my AI roadmap. I'm still reading Automate the Boring Stuff.
Today, I learned about the older style of string formatting using the % symbol.
I explored the .pyw file extension and its purpose.
I also delved into batch files—their uses and limitations.
I practiced how to copy, move, and rename files and folders using:
•	shutil.copy()
•	shutil.copytree()
•	shutil.move()

Then I finalized the section on deleting files and folders using:
•	os.unlink()
•	os.rmdir()
•	shutil.rmtree()
•	and the send2trash module.


In the afternoon, before switching to watch the National Science and Maths Quiz, 
I visited Khan Academy and studied word problems involving rational functions.
Specifically, I learned how to solve mixture problems and rate problems.

While watching the contest, I used the breaks between rounds to watch two videos on Bayes’ Theorem.

Although I didn’t touch my project today and didn’t engage with anything robotics-related, 
I still took a small step forward on my journey to becoming an AI + Robotics Engineer.


It’s Week 5, and the dream is still alive.
