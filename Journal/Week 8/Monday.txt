Reflection

- What was challenging: Internet connection was disrupted immediately after switching from math to robotics, making it unsuitable to do vital work on my project
- Key insight: To keep dreams alive, the environment matters
- Decision: Add Bible reading to my morning routine. The internet disruption made me reflect on my project of making internet free and easily accessible to all.
- Tomorrow's focus: Operate a machine alone at Peace Indo, conclude Unit 9 in Mathematics, and finish tutorials on diodes
