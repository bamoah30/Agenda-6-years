Journal Entry – October 31, 2025

Following my decision to strictly adhere to my sleep schedule, I woke up very early today.

I began the day by studying precalculus lessons on Khan Academy. 
I focused on rational expressions, vertical and horizontal asymptotes, 
and how to determine the behavior of a function as it approaches infinity from both directions.

At 4:30 a.m., I resumed my roadmap journey. 
I'm still working through Automate the Boring Stuff, continuing from Chapter 8 on file handling. 
Some new terms I picked up include:
os.path.dirname(path): Returns the directory portion of the path, excluding the final file or folder.

os.path.basename(path): Returns the final component of the path, typically the filename.

os.path.getsize(path): Returns the size of the file in bytes.

os.path.listdir(path): Lists all files and directories in the specified path.

Later, I switched to working on my first portfolio project. 
I didn’t make much progress today. 
Although the analyzer module runs smoothly, it throws an error when the AI is supposed to return insights. 
I plan to study more about APIs tomorrow to better understand what might be going wrong.
