Today, woke up feeling very refreshed. 
Started the day around 3:23am.
Watched youtube tutorial on how to use git command to create and manage branch on vs code
Planned to implement that later in the day when I'm working on my portfolio project.
Then switched to my Roadmap, still on regular expressions.
Due to yesterday's lower output, i decided to adopt new strategy to study.
Mostly, i will study and then document as I go, topic ny topic.
But today, I studied without documenting everything. I just wrote the topics down.
When, i haved studied for about one and a half hours, i puasd and started documenting. 
That strategy was superb.
I really covered alot. Just to name a few:
-Using question mark in regexes
-Matching with a Plus
-the findall() method
-Shorthand character classes 
- How to create your own character classes
-the wildcard character
-using the sub() method
-the differences between the match() and the search() method 

I was really proud of myself and plan to adopt this strategy going forward: 
Learn 1 hour + 25 min, break 5 min, document 30mins

Well, the documenting took alot of time but it was wealth it because It served as a source for me to recap
and internalized some facts.
