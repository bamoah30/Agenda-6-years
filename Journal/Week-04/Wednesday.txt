Today, woke up feeling very refreshed. 
Started the day around 3:23am.
Watched youtube tutorial on how to use git command to create and manage branch on vs code
Planned to implement that later in the day when I'm working on my portfolio project.
Then switched to my Roadmap, still on regular expressions.
Due to yesterday's lower output, i decided to adopt new strategy to study.
Mostly, i will study and then document as I go, topic ny topic.
But today, I studied without documenting everything. I just wrote the topics down.
When, i haved studied for about one and a half hours, i puasd and started documenting. 
That strategy was superb.
I really covered alot. Just to name a few:
-Using question mark in regexes
-Matching with a Plus
-the findall() method
-Shorthand character classes 
- How to create your own character classes
-the wildcard character
-using the sub() method
-the differences between the match() and the search() method 

I was really proud of myself and plan to adopt this strategy going forward: 
Learn 1 hour + 25 min, break 5 min, document 30mins

Well, the documenting took alot of time but it was wealth it because It served as a source for me to recap
and internalized some facts.

Went for a break and returned at 11 am to begin working on my project. 
AS usual, I did apply the git commamd that i learnt before starting my Roadmap.
I was able to create a a new branch, switch between branches, commit the branch to a remote repo, etc.
I worked on my analyzer module, finished it, tested it and I will be tacking the OpenAI API key initialization tomorrow.
Whilst working on the project, i learnt new concept like type hinting.

After the day, I decided to adopt a new timetable that will take into consideration the Roadmap for the programming logic,
and also make a reason block time for job application, robotics section and then Maths section.
