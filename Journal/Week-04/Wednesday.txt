Daily Log: Study Strategy Shift and Git Mastery
Today, I woke up feeling very refreshed.
Started the day around 3:23 a.m.
Watched a YouTube tutorial on how to use Git commands to create and manage branches in VS Code.
Planned to implement that later in the day when working on my portfolio project.
Then switched to my Roadmap—still on regular expressions.

Due to yesterday's lower output, I decided to adopt a new strategy for studying.
Mostly, I study and then document as I go, topic by topic.
But today, I studied without documenting everything. I just wrote the topics down.
When I had studied for about one and a half hours, I paused and started documenting.
That strategy was superb.

I really covered a lot. Just to name a few:
•	Using question mark in regexes
•	Matching with a plus
•	The findall() method
•	Shorthand character classes
•	How to create your own character classes
•	The wildcard character
•	Using the sub() method
•	The differences between the match() and the search() method

I was really proud of myself and plan to adopt this strategy going forward:
Learn 1 hour + 25 min, break 5 min, document 30 mins.
Well, the documenting took a lot of time, but it was worth it because it served as a source for me to recap
and internalize some facts.

Went for a break and returned at 11 a.m. to begin working on my project.
As usual, I applied the Git commands I had learned before starting my Roadmap.
I was able to create a new branch, switch between branches, commit the branch to a remote repo, etc.
I worked on my analyzer module, finished it, tested it, and I will be tackling the OpenAI API key initialization tomorrow.
Whilst working on the project, I learned a new concept like type hinting.


After the day, I decided to adopt a new timetable that will take into consideration the Roadmap for programming logic,
and also make reasonable block time for job applications, robotics section, and then the Maths section. I will implementthe newtimetable in the after Sunday.
