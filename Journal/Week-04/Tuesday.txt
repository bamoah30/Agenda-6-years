Daily Log — Building Through Discomfort

Today started rough. 
I had a bout of stomach trouble that kept waking me throughout the night. 
Still, I managed to catch a bit of sleep and was up before 4:30 a.m.

I kicked off the morning with a YouTube tutorial on using AI Agents in VS Code. 
It was eye-opening—tools like these are making coding feel significantly more intuitive. 
I’m definitely integrating Agents into my workflow moving forward. 
While watching, I encountered two new terms:

- MCP (Model Context Protocol):A protocol that enables agents to interact intelligently with your workspace documents.
- PRD (Product Requirements Document): A detailed document outlining a product’s features, goals, and requirements—essentially a more advanced, structured version of a README.

Remember how I’ve been using READMEs to scaffold my projects? 
PRDs feel like the next evolution—especially relevant as I start thinking like a product-minded engineer.

At 4:30 a.m., my alarm went off. 
I didn’t feel ready to move, so I lingered on my phone for five more minutes before getting up to continue my roadmap.
I revisited Automate the Boring Stuff and began exploring regular expressions. 
It didn’t feel like a major leap, but I realized how regex can simplify functions like `isPhoneNumber()`—the one we looked at on Monday. 
Learning to use expressions like `\d` for digits is a small but powerful step toward writing cleaner, more efficient code.

Later, I took a short break and returned to my first portfolio project: AI Data Analyzer. 
I applied what I learned from the VS Code tutorial, and it paid off—the AI Agent helped me move faster and more confidently. 
Along the way, I had to pick up new tools like Pandas, which I used to manipulate and analyze data. 
Every module I learn now feels like a brick in the foundation of my AI + Robotics future.

I wrapped up the day with some Khan Academy Precalculus lessons. 
Strengthening my math fundamentals is part of the long game—especially as I prepare for the more technical aspects of robotics and machine learning.
