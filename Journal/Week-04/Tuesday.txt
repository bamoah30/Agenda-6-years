Today, I didn't feel so well as I had a running stomach which kept waking me several times in the middle of my sleep.
But, I managed to get a little sleep. Woke up before 4:30 am.
Watched a youtube tutorial on using Agents in Vs-code
It's was so cool, I think coding became much more easier wiht tool like Agents in Vs code.
I will be using the Agent in most of my code. Well, whilst watching the Youtube video, I came across some new terms: MCP and PRD
MCP(Model Context Protocol) is basically a protocol to help the agent interact well with your workspace document
PRD (Product Requirements Document): A comprehensive document that outlines the requirements, features and objectives of a product. It used as a reference for those with whom the product is concerned.
Remember I told you about using ReadMe as a starting point? Well, PRD is like an advanced ReadME.

After the video, around 4:30 am, alarm went off, I didn't feel like it, stayed on my phone screen for additional 5 minutes befreo i got out of bed to continue my roadmap, remember Automating the boring Stuff?
I it didn't feel like i did much, but i started exploring regular expressions.
It turns out that with regular expressions you can simplify the isPhoneNumber() function  we saw on Monday.
But then, to use regular expressions, you have to understan a lot of it's key words like the \d for digits and other expressions.


I went for a break for sometime and resumed working on my first portfolio project - AI data Analyzer
I used the skills i acquired from watching the VS code tutorial. After, the skills didn't go to waste.
The AI agent helped me moved faster. Well, whilst using the AI, i had to learn certain modules like pandas and how to use them.


I ended the day with some Khanacademy Precalculus lessons.
