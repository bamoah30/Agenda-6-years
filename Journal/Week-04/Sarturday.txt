Journal Entry — November 1, 2025

I woke up today feeling very exhausted, though I’m not sure what caused it.
Due to that, in the afternoon, I spent alot of time in bed and nearly miss my schedule for my project.

Continued with Automate the Boring Stuff. 
I was on Chapter 8 — and I finished it today. 
I learned how to open files using the open() function, which defaults to read mode (r). 
In read mode, you can't modify the file. 
To make changes, you use write mode (w) or append mode (a). 
Write mode replaces the entire content of the file, while append mode adds new content to the end.

I also explored the shelve module, which allows you to store data persistently like a dictionary.

After a break, I resumed work on my project, AI Data Analyzer. 
I tried getting the scripts to run and began reading about Hugging Face models and how to integrate them into my project. 
I learned what NLP and LLM mean — and that LLMs are a subset of NLP.

I also came across Transformers.
Transformers are an architecture—a blueprint for how neural networks are structured
—and the Hugging Face Transformers library is the platform for implementing them.

I plan to read more about Transformers. They might be the key to getting my analyzer module fully operational

Going forward, I do plan to use my weekends to reflect, 
adjust my daily schedule and review the week's work and plan for the next week.
