Week 4 Kickoff – October 27, 2025
Started at 4:30 am. By 5:00 am, I was deep into *Automate the Boring Stuff* (Chapter 7). Hit a wall with “isPhoneNumber(text)” — realized I needed to master programming logic.  
Built a 4-week logic roadmap to run in parallel with my main track (2:30–4:00 pm daily).  

Kicked off my milestone project: AI Data Analyzer.  
Didn’t know where to begin, so I started with research and structured the README. That file became my compass.  
 
Lesson of the day: When in doubt, write the README first.  

Mission: Building Intelligent Autonomous Systems That Think, Move, and Adapt.
