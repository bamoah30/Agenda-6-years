Journal Entry – October 30, 2025 

Today, I woke up feeling less energized. I think it's because I slept around 11pm the night before. 
Moving forward, I plan to stick strictly to my sleeping time. 

Though my eyes opened before 4:30am, I didn't get out of bed. 
I didn't do anything either—just lay there until I fell asleep again. 
Then the alarm went off. I managed to wake up. 

I sat down to continue my Roadmap and moved to Chapter 8 of Automate the Boring Stuff. 
I began reading about how to handle files and directories. 
I learned some basic commands like `os.getcwd()` for getting the current working directory, 
and explored what `os.path` does. 
I discovered that `os.path.join()` is particularly useful because 
it handles path separators differently across operating systems, which will be important for writing portable code. 


The time moved quickly. 
By 12pm, I switched to work on my project, ai-data-analyzer. 
I discovered that using the OpenAI API requires a credit or debit card, which I don't currently have. 
So I searched for alternatives and chose the Hugging Face API, which opened up their entire model hub for exploration. 
I started modifying my Phase 2 README to reflect that change, 
then updated the analyzer module accordingly. 
I debugged to get the AI-generated code working and began the process of generating a token for the Hugging Face API. 
Though I didn't finish testing the analyzer module, 
I'm planning to complete it by tomorrow and document the differences between the OpenAI and Hugging Face implementations. 


Due to the lower output today, I plan to abide strictly by my 9:45pm wind-down routine. 
I'll be using this journal as my point of reflection. 
That means I'll start making entries only around 8pm, when I'm about to sleep, 
though I'll jot down technical notes during the day to capture details while they're fresh.
