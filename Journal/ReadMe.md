# Journal

This folder documents my transformation into a Ai + Robotics engineer — blending mechanical depth with intelligent software to build autonomous systems that think, move, and adapt.

Each week is organized into its own folder (`Week-01`, `Week-02`, etc.), containing daily text entries that capture:

- Technical breakthroughs and challenges
- Emotional reflections and mindset shifts
- Strategic pivots in my roadmap
- Milestones, insights, and lessons learned

### 📅 Structure

├── README.md
├── Week-04/
└── Monday.txt

└──Wednesday.txt
└──Thursday.txt
└──Friday.txt

Each `.txt` file is named by days and contains a raw, honest snapshot of that day’s journey — from early morning routines to late-night breakthroughs.

This journal is part of my commitment to public learning, emotional clarity, and legacy-building through transparent documentation.

> _“Every line of code, every reflection, every pivot — it’s all part of the system I’m engineering: myself.”_
