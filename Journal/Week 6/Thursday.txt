- Concepts applied: No progress made today  
- Key takeaway: Time constraints limited my ability to engage with robotics  
- Time spent: 0 minutes  

Mathematics Roadmap  
- Topic: Three- and four-dimensional transformations using matrices  
- Progress: Completed two intermediate exercises  
- What made sense: The exercises clarified the transformation concepts  
- What's still unclear: Initial confusion around dimensional mapping  
- Time spent: 1 hour  

Projects  
- Project: None  
- Work completed: No updates today  
- Decisions made: Deferred robotics work due to time constraints  
- Blockers/next steps: Resume robotics project tomorrow  
- Time spent: 0 minutes  

Professional Development  
- Activities: Interview with Zonda, reviewed company history and technical terms related to vehicle bodywork  
- Outcome: Decided not to pursue further interviews with Zonda due to misalignment with AI and robotics aspirations. Opted to accept offer from Peace Indo as a machine operator. Registered  SSNIT.
