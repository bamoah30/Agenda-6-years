Journal Entry – November 12, 2025

I woke up at 4:30 am, as usual, and spent some quiet time reflecting before switching focus to my AI journey.

On today’s AI roadmap, I learned how to use the BeautifulSoup library to create a BeautifulSoup object. 
I also practiced using the select method to extract elements from HTML.
Whilst reading, I came across few websites for Unicode encoding. I added those websites to my reading list for the weekend.

After about an hour of studying, I switched to listening to the Copilot Daily podcast, 
followed by the Merriam-Webster Word of the Day podcast. 
While doing some domestic chores, I continued listening to Atomic Habits. 
This time, I covered Chapters 3 through 10. The audiobook has a total of 20 chapters, so I’m halfway through.

At 9 am, I followed up with the company that accepted me for a job to finalize some documents. 
Later, I received a call from Zonda inviting me to an interview tomorrow.

By 11 am, I began working on my first portfolio project, AI Data Analyzer. 
I managed to make the CLI script functional and then started building the GUI using Streamlit. 
My goal is to complete the GUI section tomorrow, provided the interview doesn’t interfere too much with my schedule.

After a 30-minute break, at 1 pm, I continued with my Khan Academy precalculus lessons. 
I finished the last unit on vectors and scored 90% on the unit test. 
Afterwards, I started Unit 7 on matrices, learning how they simplify linear transformations. 
I’m hopeful that by the end of this week, I’ll complete the course and move on to linear algebra.

At 6 pm, after a two-hour break and more domestic errands, I resumed my robotics roadmap. 
I studied circuit theory, focusing on dependent and independent current and voltage sources, and worked through several example problems. 
By the start of Week 7, I expect to finish this section as well.

Going forward, I would adopt a template for this journal entry as that would make it easier for me to reference and also more transparent.
The template would follow the usual pattern I have been using.The template is named template.md. You can find it in this directory.

Overall, I feel I’m making steady progress in the direction of  a better future.
