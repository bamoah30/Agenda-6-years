Journal Entry – November 11, 2025

I started the day with debugging. I learned how to use the IDLE debugger. 
I was able to set breakpoints and use tools like "step into." 
I also tracked  local and global variables in my script during the debugging process.

After about 30 minutes, I shifted focus to web scraping. 
I learned how to use the `requests` library and the `webbrowser` module to automate simple tasks.

One hour later, I paused to handle some domestic chores. 
Before the chores, I listened to Copilot Daily and the Merriam-Webster Word of the Day podcast. 
While doing the dishes, I listened to the first two chapters of an audiobook titled Atomic Habits.

At 9am, I checked on my job applications and received an appointment letter. 
Although the terms and conditions aren't ideal, I'm considering accepting it while continuing to explore other opportunities.

Around 11 am, I resumed work on my project, AI Data Analyzer. 
I'm still on Phase 3 and spent time debugging `main.py`. I didn’t finish, but I hope to wrap it up tomorrow.

Later in the afternoon, I studied mathematics on Khan Academy and completed Lesson 9 of Unit 6. 
I then ran a few domestic errands.

In the evening at 7pm, I attended a webinar titled SEED Virtual STEM Masters Conclave – Ghana, 
organized by Seed Global Education. 
Unfortunately, my network was unstable, so I couldn’t fully participate. 
Still, the parts I caught were inspiring and reminded me to stay committed to pursuing higher education.

Tomorrow, I plan to repeat productive activities and then discard those activities which stalled my progress 
like spending more time than required on breaks.
