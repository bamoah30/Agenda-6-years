Journal Entry – November 14, 2025 | Week 6, Day 5

Morning  
- Wake-up time: 5:22 am  
- Morning routine: Identified why I wasn’t hearing the alarm at 4:30 am and resolved it.  
- Mindset going into the day: Frustrated with myself for assuming I could wake up at 4:30 am with or without an alarm.  

AI Roadmap  
- Topic studied: openpyxl module  
- Key learning: Learned how to create a workbook object, access sheets by name, and retrieve cell values.  
- Challenge/blocker: The book’s methods were outdated, so I had to search online for updated approaches.  
- Time spent: 38 minutes  

Robotics Roadmap  
- Topic studied: Circuit theorem  
- Concepts applied: Nodal and Supernodal Analysis  
- Key takeaway: Grounding voltage sources before performing mesh analysis simplifies the process.  
- Time spent: 1 hour  

Mathematics Roadmap  
- Topic: Matrices  
- Progress: Learned how to determine the inverse of a matrix.  
- What made sense: From previous knowledge, the absolute determinant shows how much the area of a transformed vector is scaled. A zero determinant means no area, so there is no inverse matrix that can transform “no area” back into a matrix with area.  
- Time spent: 2 hours  

Projects  
- Project: AI Data Analyzer  
- Work completed: Finalized the GUI with Streamlit and tested every script.  
- Decisions made: Selected the Novita model as the sole provider of insights from the HuggingFace API due to endpoint inference challenges.  
- Blockers/next steps: Edit all README files and create a LinkedIn post about the project.  
- Time spent: 2 hours  

Professional Development  
- Activities: Received a call from Rana Motors for an assessment scheduled for next Friday.  
- Outcome: Decided not to attend due to a poor offer and a job description misaligned with my interests. Printed all necessary documents for employment at Peace Indo.  

Resources & Reading  
- Resources found today: Documentation for openpyxl  
- Content consumed: Read *Automate the Boring Stuff*, listened to Copilot Daily, studied Khan Academy Precalculus, and reviewed circuit concepts from Engineering4Free.  

Reflection  
- What went well: My first portfolio project is fully functional, and I followed my roadmaps successfully.  
- What was challenging: Low motivation to start coding early in the morning.  
- Key insight: Attention is the most valuable asset—choose carefully what to give it to.  
- Tomorrow’s focus: Review the week’s work and read a research paper on AI and Robotics.
